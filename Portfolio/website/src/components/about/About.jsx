                            Since high school, my love for coding started to grow into a wonderful passion, because I was always in awe on how
                            it could transform various ideas, solutions, and instructions into a programming language that the
                            computer can understand. In addition to this, it helped shape my skills in problem-solving and analysis,
                            such as finding errors efficiently or thinking about a program logically.
