This was a personal project that I wanted to do for a long time. However, since I was busy with college coursework, I didn't have enough time. Now that I have some free time, I decided to create some projects to help sharpen my skills, and make me stand out in the market. One of them is a React Portfolio Website, where I talk about who I am as a person, what are some of the hobbies I love to do, what are some of the professioanl skills I have from learing in college, and in part-time jobs, what are some of the projects I have done so far, and what is the best way to reach out to me.

Below is a link to the video I used from a YouTube channel called Lama Dev on how to create my React portfolio website. I want to thank them for a great resouce and to help give me an idea on how to style my website.
